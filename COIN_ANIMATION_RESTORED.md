# ✅ COIN ANIMATION RESTORED + ICON DEBUG ADDED

## 🎯 Changes Made:

### ✅ FIX 1: Restored Original CSS Coin Animation
**Problem**: Framer Motion changed the coin appearance  
**Solution**: Reverted back to CSS keyframe animations

**Changes**:
- ❌ Removed Framer Motion `motion.div` and `motion.img`
- ✅ Restored CSS animation: `coinRotate` + `coinFloat`
- ✅ Restored original drop-shadow glow
- ✅ Added error logging for coin image
- ✅ Added fallback path attempt

**Animation**:
```css
animation: coinRotate 4s linear infinite, coinFloat 3s ease-in-out infinite
```

### ✅ FIX 2: Enhanced Icon Loading Debug
**Problem**: Icons not appearing (showing generic placeholders)  
**Solution**: Added detailed logging to diagnose the issue

**Changes**:
- ✅ Added `onLoad` handler → logs success
- ✅ Enhanced `onError` handler → logs failure details
- ✅ Added red border on error (visual debug)
- ✅ Don't hide failed images (keep trying)

**Console Logs**:
```
✅ Successfully loaded: /icons/speed.png
✅ Successfully loaded: /icons/security.png
✅ Successfully loaded: /icons/low-fee.png
```

OR if failing:
```
❌ Failed to load icon: /icons/speed.png
Image element: <img>
Attempted path: /icons/speed.png
```

## 🚀 NOW: Refresh Browser and Check Console

### STEP 1: Hard Refresh
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### STEP 2: Open DevTools
```
F12 → Console tab
```

### STEP 3: Check Logs
Look for:
```
🎯 HeroWithAssets mounted
📁 Checking assets...
✅ Loaded: /solana-coin.png
✅ Loaded: /icons/speed.png
✅ Loaded: /icons/security.png
✅ Loaded: /icons/low-fee.png
```

AND when scrolling to features:
```
✅ Successfully loaded: /icons/speed.png
✅ Successfully loaded: /icons/security.png
✅ Successfully loaded: /icons/low-fee.png
```

---

## ✅ What You Should See:

### Coin (Hero Section):
- ✅ **Solana logo coin** (not striped ball)
- ✅ **Rotating 360°** (4 second loop)
- ✅ **Floating up/down** (3 second loop)
- ✅ **Purple glow** shadow

### Icons (Features Section):
- ✅ **Leonardo AI PNG images** (not generic icons)
- ✅ **White filtered** icons
- ✅ **Pink, blue, green** gradient boxes

---

## 🔍 If Icons STILL Don't Show:

### Check Console for Error Messages:
If you see:
```
❌ Failed to load icon: /icons/speed.png
```

Then the issue is one of:
1. **File path problem** - Next.js not serving from `/public/`
2. **File permissions** - Can't read the files
3. **Build cache** - Old build still cached

### Try This:
```powershell
# 1. Stop server
Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force

# 2. Clear everything
Remove-Item -Path ".next" -Recurse -Force
Remove-Item -Path "node_modules/.cache" -Recurse -Force

# 3. Restart
npm run dev

# 4. Open incognito
Ctrl + Shift + N → localhost:3001
```
