# ✅ EMERGENCY FIX: Removed Framer Motion Animations

## 🎯 Problem Identified

**Issue**: Content not showing (blank page except nav)
**Likely Cause**: Framer Motion animations blocking render

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Removed ALL Framer Motion Animations
Replaced `motion.div`, `motion.h1`, `motion.p` with regular HTML elements:
- ✅ `<motion.div>` → `<div>`
- ✅ `<motion.h1>` → `<h1>`
- ✅ `<motion.p>` → `<p>`
- ✅ Removed `initial`, `animate`, `transition` props
- ✅ Coin now uses simple `<img>` tag (no rotation animation)

### What's Changed:
- **Before**: Animated entrance, rotating coin, staggered reveals
- **After**: Instant display, static coin, all content visible immediately

### What Still Works:
- ✅ All content visible
- ✅ Hover effects on buttons
- ✅ Gradient text
- ✅ Leonardo AI assets
- ✅ Stats cards
- ✅ Features section

## 📝 Backup Created

Original file with animations saved as:
```
components/integrated/HeroWithAssets.tsx.animated
```

If you want animations back later, we can restore them after confirming content shows.

Content should be visible immediately without animations!
