- Bank Transfer: $25-50 fee + 5-7 days

### SolPay Express Solution
- **Cost**: < $0.01 per transaction (99% cheaper)
- **Speed**: < 2 seconds (1000x faster)
- **Professional**: Built-in invoicing

### Real Example
**Traditional**: Client pays $1000 → Freelancer receives $940 (after fees) in 3-5 days
**SolPay Express**: Client pays $1000 USDC → Freelancer receives $999.99 in 2 seconds

**Savings**: $60 per $1000 = 6% saved!
