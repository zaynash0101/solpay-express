## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invoice not found"
**Solution**: Make sure you're using a valid invoice ID from demo data:
- `inv-1`, `inv-2`, `inv-3` (paid)
- `inv-4`, `inv-5` (pending)

### Issue: Share button not appearing
**Solution**: 
- Only pending/overdue invoices show Share button
- Paid/cancelled invoices don't have Share button
- Refresh the page to reload invoices

### Issue: BlinkPreview modal not opening
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for errors
- Make sure BlinkPreview component is imported
- Verify state management in InvoiceList

### Issue: Social share buttons not working
**Solution**:
- Check if pop-up blocker is enabled
- Try allowing pop-ups for localhost
- Test in different browser

### Issue: API returning 404
**Solution**:
- Restart dev server (`npm run dev`)
- Check file exists: `app/api/actions/invoice/route.ts`
- Verify Next.js API routes are working

### Issue: CORS errors
**Solution**:
- Check `next.config.js` has CORS headers
- Restart dev server after config changes
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: Transaction failing
**Solution**:
